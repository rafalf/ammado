__The ammado Giving Widget - What is it?__
The ammado Giving Widget is our flagship feature and encompasses our entire powerful donation technology.

The widget offers secure global donations in more than 75 currencies, and most major global and local payment methods. Like the rest of the ammado platform, it is supported by 12 languages. Language, currency and payment methods automatically adjust to the donor's location, so all manual hassle is removed. To provide sustainable support, donors can set up repeat donations directly through the Giving Widget.

You can donate through the Giving Widget all over the ammado platform (view your own Giving Widget by adding /donate to the URL of your ammado profile), but it can also be placed on any website, blog or intranet to allow for donations right there and then - in your own online environment.
